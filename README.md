# Descriptions
In this program, we will attempt to install a python module .whl, .zip and .tar.gz, from
local machine! It is not limited for an independent module only. He will **find the respective dependences** of your module!!

When your module dependecies files are not already in your machine, don't worry, there is a failure manager file that will be created and the *installation continue*.
You can then read the missing one and get it in the future.
